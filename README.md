This project is a data cleaning task that is used to demontrate my ability to clean a dataset using the Power BI's Power Query. 

# Objective and Problem Statement
The main purpose of this approach is to eliminate the following occurrences to ensure reliable and accurate data for further analysis.
- Correcting Inaccuracies and Errors
- Standardizing and Transforming Data
- Handling Special Characters and Encoding Issues

# Description of the FIFA 21 Dataset
This FIFA 2021 dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring/).
The raw dataset was scraped from sofifa.com, containing 18,979 players and 77 data points on their performance. It comes with a handy guide to decipher player info. 
The columns in the dataset includes ID, Name, Long Name, photo URL, player URL, Nationality, Age, OVA, POT, Contract, Positions, Height, Preferred Foot, BOV, Best Position, Joined, Loan Date End, Value, Wage, Release Clause, W/F, SM, A/W, D/W, IR, PAS, DRI.
